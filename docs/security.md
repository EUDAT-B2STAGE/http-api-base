#Â Security

*This is a new feature!*

I integrated basic **Flask-Security** endpoints inside the REST API code.
This means that you may use Token based authentication
with triplets (user, pwd, role) saved in sqllite db.


## Documentation to be written!

---

Note: Security is enabled by default.
You can disable it with the option `--no-security` to the run script
(`run.py`).

To change it modify `docker-compose.py`.
