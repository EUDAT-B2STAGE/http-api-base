# rest-mock

A python3 flask HTTP server mapping classes into REST API endpoints;
**the base** for any middleware APIs in my projects.

It comes bundled with:

* RESTful classes to write endpoints
* decorators to add properties and parameters
* as many best practices i found in my experience for Flask
* easy configuration
* sqlalchemy (sqllite as default) backend
* any database/resource pluggable (in fact, you can write your own)
* security handling (JWT token will be added)
* administration
